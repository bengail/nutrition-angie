<section id="origin">
  <h2>Document Origin</h2>

  <div class="podcast">
    🎙️ <strong>Podcast context:</strong>
    The original discussion highlights how many athletes believe they are fueling
    adequately while living in chronic underfueling, often without weight loss.
  </div>

  <p>
    This document takes that observation and builds the full conceptual and practical
    framework needed to understand <em>why</em> this happens and <em>how</em> to fix it.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="big-picture">
  <h2>The Big Picture: What Fueling Really Means</h2>

  <p>
    Fueling is not about eating “enough” in a vague sense.
    It is about supplying sufficient energy and carbohydrates to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Support training load</li>
    <li>Allow physiological adaptation</li>
    <li>Maintain hormonal and metabolic health</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 <strong>Key reframing:</strong>
    Fueling is a performance variable, not a body-weight variable.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="ea">
  <h2>Energy Availability: The Central Concept</h2>

  <div class="podcast">
    🎙️ The podcast repeatedly refers to athletes “not eating enough”
    without always naming the underlying mechanism.
  </div>

  <p>
    The correct framework is <strong>Energy Availability (EA)</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 <strong>Definition:</strong><br>
    EA = (Energy intake − Exercise energy expenditure) ÷ Fat-free mass
  </div>

  <div class="research">
    🧪 <strong>Research consensus:</strong>
    EA below ~30 kcal/kg FFM/day is associated with RED-S, hormonal suppression,
    impaired recovery, and performance decline (IOC consensus).
  </div>

  <div class="warning">
    ⚠️ <strong>Oversimplification risk:</strong>
    EA is not something athletes should calculate daily —
    it is a diagnostic and educational tool.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="weight">
  <h2>Why Weight Is a Misleading Signal</h2>

  <div class="podcast">
    🎙️ A central message of the podcast is that athletes can maintain weight
    while being underfueled.
  </div>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 <strong>Why this happens:</strong>
    The body adapts by lowering resting metabolic rate,
    suppressing reproductive hormones,
    and reducing non-essential physiological functions.
  </div>

  <div class="research">
    🧪 Weight stability during underfueling is well documented,
    especially in endurance athletes with high training volumes.
  </div>

  <div class="takeaway">
    ✅ Weight is an outcome variable — not a fueling validation tool.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="carbs">
  <h2>Carbohydrates vs Calories</h2>

  <p>
    One concept only indirectly addressed in the podcast is
    <strong>carbohydrate availability</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 You can meet calorie needs and still underfuel carbohydrates,
    impairing training quality and adaptation.
  </div>

  <div class="research">
    🧪 Carbohydrate availability directly influences:
    training intensity, hormonal response, and perceived exertion
    (Burke et al.).
  </div>

  <div class="warning">
    ⚠️ “Eating clean” often unintentionally reduces carbohydrate density.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="adaptation">
  <h2>Adaptation vs Survival Mode</h2>

  <p>
    The body constantly decides whether resources allow adaptation
    or require protection.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 Low energy availability signals the body to prioritize survival
    over performance adaptation.
  </div>

  <div class="podcast">
    🎙️ This explains why athletes feel “stuck” despite consistent training.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="signals">
  <h2>Recognizing Underfueling Signals</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Persistent fatigue</li>
    <li>Plateau despite training consistency</li>
    <li>Increased injury or illness frequency</li>
    <li>Sleep disturbances</li>
    <li>Mood changes</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="warning">
    ⚠️ Hunger cues are unreliable under chronic underfueling.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="practice">
  <h2>How to Fuel Correctly in Practice</h2>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 Fueling should scale with training load — daily and weekly.
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Fuel sessions, not just days</li>
    <li>Carbohydrates before and during key sessions</li>
    <li>Recovery fueling as a priority, not an afterthought</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="takeaway">
    ✅ Fueling is proactive, not compensatory.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="endurance">
  <h2>Endurance & Trail-Specific Considerations</h2>

  <div class="endurance">
    🏔️ High volume + long low-intensity sessions increase underfueling risk,
    especially when athletes rely on appetite alone.
  </div>

  <div class="endurance">
    🏔️ Fueling during long runs is not just race practice —
    it protects energy availability.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Final Synthesis</h2>

  <p>
    The podcast accurately identifies a widespread issue:
    chronic, unintentional underfueling.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 The solution is not more discipline,
    but better understanding of physiology.
  </div>

  <div class="takeaway">
    ✅ Fueling is an enabler of adaptation, not a reward.
  </div>
