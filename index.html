<section id="origin">
  <h2>Document Origin</h2>

  <div class="podcast">
    🎙️ <strong>Podcast insight:</strong>
    The original podcast highlights a common issue: many athletes believe they are fueling
    adequately while unknowingly living in a state of chronic underfueling.
  </div>

  <p>
    This document takes that observation and expands it into a structured framework.
    The goal is not to summarize the podcast, but to use it as an entry point
    to understand the underlying physiology, concepts, and practical decisions
    required to fuel correctly for endurance performance.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="big-picture">
  <h2>What Fueling Actually Means</h2>

  <p>
    Fueling is often reduced to vague advice such as “eat enough” or “listen to your body.”
    In reality, fueling is a performance variable that must align with training load,
    recovery demands, and long-term adaptation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Proper fueling enables three essential processes:
    supporting the work performed during training,
    recovering from that work,
    and allowing the body to adapt positively over time.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 <strong>Key reframing:</strong>
    Fueling is not about controlling body weight.
    It is about providing the resources required for adaptation.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="ea">
  <h2>Energy Availability: The Core Concept</h2>

  <div class="podcast">
    🎙️ The podcast repeatedly refers to athletes “not eating enough,”
    often without explicitly naming the mechanism behind it.
  </div>

  <p>
    The most accurate framework to understand this issue is
    <strong>Energy Availability (EA)</strong>.
    EA describes how much energy remains available to the body
    after the cost of exercise is removed.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 <strong>Definition:</strong><br />
    Energy Availability =
    (Energy intake − Exercise energy expenditure) ÷ Fat-free mass
  </div>

  <p>
    When energy availability is chronically low,
    the body begins to reduce or shut down processes
    that are not essential for immediate survival.
  </p>

  <div class="research">
    🧪 Research consistently shows that low EA
    is associated with impaired recovery,
    hormonal suppression,
    increased injury risk,
    and reduced performance capacity.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="weight">
  <h2>Why Body Weight Is a Poor Guide</h2>

  <div class="podcast">
    🎙️ A key message of the podcast is that athletes can maintain
    stable body weight while still being underfueled.
  </div>

  <p>
    This is often confusing for athletes,
    because weight stability is commonly interpreted
    as proof that intake and output are balanced.
  </p>

  <p>
    In reality, the body adapts to chronic energy deficiency
    by reducing resting metabolic rate,
    altering hormonal output,
    and lowering non-essential energy expenditure.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 Weight maintenance can occur alongside declining physiological function.
  </div>

  <div class="warning">
    ⚠️ Body weight is an outcome variable.
    It is not a reliable indicator of adequate fueling.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="carbs">
  <h2>Carbohydrates vs Total Energy</h2>

  <p>
    Another concept only indirectly addressed in the podcast
    is the difference between total energy intake
    and carbohydrate availability.
  </p>

  <p>
    An athlete may consume sufficient calories overall,
    yet still underfuel carbohydrates relative to training demands.
    This has direct consequences for training quality,
    recovery, and adaptation.
  </p>

  <div class="research">
    🧪 Carbohydrate availability influences perceived exertion,
    hormonal responses, and the ability to sustain intensity,
    independent of total calorie intake.
  </div>

  <div class="warning">
    ⚠️ Diets emphasizing “clean” or low-energy-density foods
    often unintentionally reduce carbohydrate intake.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="physiology">
  <h2>Physiology Behind Underfueling</h2>

  <p>
    Chronic underfueling does not cause the body to “break.”
    Instead, it causes the body to adapt in ways
    that prioritize survival over performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Hormonal Downregulation</h3>

  <p>
    Low energy availability leads to suppression of thyroid hormones,
    reproductive hormones, and changes in cortisol regulation.
    These changes reduce energy expenditure
    but also impair recovery and adaptation.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Hunger Becomes Unreliable</h3>

  <p>
    Over time, chronic energy deficit alters hunger and satiety signaling.
    Athletes may experience blunted appetite
    despite insufficient intake.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    ⚠️ Loss of hunger is often a warning sign,
    not proof of adequate fueling.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="models">
  <h2>Visual Models for Understanding Fueling</h2>

  <h3>The Energy Allocation Funnel</h3>

  <div class="model">
    <p>
      Energy consumed is not distributed equally across bodily functions.
      The body allocates energy according to priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Vital functions (brain, organs)</li>
      <li>Movement and daily activity</li>
      <li>Recovery and immune function</li>
      <li>Adaptation and performance gains</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      When energy availability is insufficient,
      adaptation is the first process to be reduced.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Adaptation vs Protection Mode</h3>

  <div class="model">
    <p>
      The body constantly evaluates whether resources are sufficient
      to support improvement,
      or whether it must shift into protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chronic underfueling shifts the body toward protection mode,
      making performance gains increasingly difficult
      regardless of training quality.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="audit">
  <h2>Fueling Audit Checklist</h2>

  <p>
    This checklist is designed to help athletes assess
    whether their fueling is aligned with their training,
    without counting calories or tracking macros.
  </p>

  <h3>Training Alignment</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>⬜ I fuel before key or demanding sessions</li>
    <li>⬜ I consume carbohydrates during sessions longer than 75–90 minutes</li>
    <li>⬜ My intake increases on high-volume or high-intensity days</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recovery & Adaptation Signals</h3>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>⬜ I generally recover within 24–48 hours</li>
    <li>⬜ My performance trends improve across training blocks</li>
    <li>⬜ I am not frequently injured or ill</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Behavioral Red Flags</h3>
  <ul class="checklist warning-list">
    <li>⬜ I regularly delay eating after training</li>
    <li>⬜ I avoid carbohydrates outside of training sessions</li>
    <li>⬜ I rely solely on hunger cues to decide intake</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="takeaway">
    ✅ Multiple unchecked items or repeated red flags
    strongly suggest misaligned fueling,
    regardless of body weight.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="endurance">
  <h2>Endurance-Specific Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Endurance and trail athletes face a unique risk profile
    due to high training volume
    and prolonged low-intensity sessions.
  </p>

  <div class="endurance">
    🏔️ Long sessions often produce weak hunger signals
    despite substantial energy cost.
  </div>

  <p>
    Energy deficits in endurance sports
    often accumulate gradually across days,
    rather than appearing as an acute failure.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Final Synthesis</h2>

  <p>
    The podcast accurately identifies a widespread issue:
    chronic, often unintentional underfueling among endurance athletes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solution is not increased discipline or restriction,
    but a better understanding of physiology
    and a shift toward fueling as a performance tool.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 Fueling enables adaptation.
    Without sufficient energy availability,
    training stress cannot be translated into performance gains.
