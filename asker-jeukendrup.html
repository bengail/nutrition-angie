  <h2>Who Is Asker Jeukendrup?</h2>

  <p>
    Asker Jeukendrup, PhD, is one of the most influential sport nutrition researchers
    in endurance sport. His research fundamentally reshaped how athletes understand
    carbohydrate fueling, intestinal absorption, and gastrointestinal limitations
    during prolonged exercise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over several decades, his work bridged laboratory physiology and real-world
    endurance performance, influencing recommendations now used across cycling,
    running, triathlon, and ultra-endurance disciplines.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="framework">
  <h2>The Modern Fueling Framework</h2>

  <p>
    Traditional endurance nutrition focused primarily on glycogen depletion
    and post-exercise replenishment. Jeukendrup’s work contributed to a shift
    toward understanding fueling as a *dynamic, during-exercise process*.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 Modern fueling aims to:
    sustain power output,
    reduce physiological stress,
    preserve central drive,
    and protect long-term health.
  </div>

  <p>
    This framework recognizes that performance limitations are often imposed
    not by muscle capacity, but by fuel delivery systems —
    particularly the gastrointestinal tract.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="carbs">
  <h2>Role of Carbohydrates in Endurance Physiology</h2>

  <p>
    Carbohydrates play a central role in endurance performance because they provide
    a rapidly oxidizable fuel source capable of supporting moderate to high exercise
    intensities. Muscle glycogen and blood glucose supply ATP at rates
    that fat oxidation alone cannot match.
  </p>

  <p>
    From a physiological perspective, carbohydrate availability influences:
    motor unit recruitment,
    exercise economy,
    and the regulation of exercise intensity.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 Even in well-trained, fat-adapted athletes,
    carbohydrate oxidation remains essential
    when intensity increases or fatigue accumulates.
  </div>

  <p>
    Importantly, carbohydrates also support immune function and recovery,
    linking performance nutrition to broader health outcomes.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="oxidation">
  <h2>Limits of Carbohydrate Oxidation</h2>

  <p>
    Early research demonstrated that ingesting glucose during exercise
    leads to a plateau in exogenous carbohydrate oxidation
    at approximately 60 grams per hour.
  </p>

  <p>
    This limitation is not caused by muscular inability to use carbohydrates,
    but by intestinal transport constraints.
    Glucose absorption relies primarily on the SGLT1 transporter,
    which becomes saturated at moderate intake levels.
  </p>

  <div class="research">
    🧪 This insight shifted attention away from muscles
    toward the gut as a performance-limiting system.
  </div>

  <p>
    Understanding this bottleneck was foundational
    to redefining endurance fueling strategies.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="multiple">
  <h2>Multiple Transportable Carbohydrates</h2>

  <p>
    Jeukendrup’s landmark contribution was demonstrating that combining
    carbohydrates using different intestinal transporters
    (notably glucose and fructose)
    increases total absorption and oxidation rates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Glucose and maltodextrin use the SGLT1 transporter,
    while fructose uses GLUT5.
    By engaging multiple pathways,
    total carbohydrate delivery to working muscles increases.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 This discovery enabled practical fueling targets
    of 90 g/h and beyond in elite endurance contexts.
  </div>

  <p>
    This concept now underpins modern sports nutrition products
    and race fueling strategies across endurance disciplines.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="gut">
  <h2>Gut Physiology & Training the Intestine</h2>

  <p>
    Gastrointestinal distress is a leading cause of performance failure
    in endurance events. Historically, this was attributed to individual intolerance.
    Jeukendrup’s work reframed the gut as a trainable organ.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regular exposure to carbohydrates during training
    increases transporter expression,
    improves gastric emptying,
    and enhances intestinal absorption efficiency.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 The gut adapts to what it is repeatedly asked to process.
  </div>

  <p>
    This concept of “gut training” emphasizes progressive fueling practice
    rather than avoidance,
    aligning physiological adaptation with performance goals.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="cns">
  <h2>Central Nervous System Effects</h2>

  <p>
    Beyond substrate supply to muscles,
    carbohydrate intake influences central nervous system function.
    Carbohydrate presence in the mouth and gut
    activates neural pathways linked to motivation and perceived effort.
  </p>

  <p>
    These central effects help explain why carbohydrate intake
    can improve performance even when muscle glycogen is not fully depleted.
  </p>

  <div class="research">
    🧪 CNS-mediated effects reinforce the importance
    of carbohydrate availability beyond simple energy provision.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="training">
  <h2>Integration Into Training</h2>

  <p>
    A critical implication of Jeukendrup’s work
    is that fueling strategies must be practiced during training,
    not improvised on race day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Endurance athletes should align carbohydrate intake
    with session demands,
    progressively increasing both quantity and complexity
    as training load rises.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    ⚠️ Avoiding carbohydrates in training
    often leads to underperformance and gut intolerance in competition.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="health">
  <h2>Performance vs Long-Term Health</h2>

  <p>
    Adequate carbohydrate intake supports not only performance,
    but also hormonal regulation,
    immune function,
    and overall energy availability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chronic carbohydrate restriction in high-volume endurance training
    increases the risk of low energy availability,
    endocrine disruption,
    and injury.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 Fueling is a health behavior, not just a race strategy.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="synthesis">
  <h2>Final Synthesis</h2>

  <p>
    The work associated with Asker Jeukendrup
    reshaped endurance nutrition by identifying the gut —
    not the muscle —
    as a primary limiter of fuel delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern endurance fueling strategies
    are grounded in physiology,
    supported by decades of research,
    and essential for both performance and health.
  </p>

  <div class="science">
    🧠 High carbohydrate availability enables sustained intensity,
    preserves central drive,
    and supports long-term adaptation.
